    "\n",
    "* As a whole, schools with higher budgets did not yield better test results. By contrast, schools with higher spending per student actually (\\$645-675) underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets (<\\$585 per student).\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%).\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a whole, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Additional comments:**_\n",
    "\n",
    "* The discrepancy between the top five performing schools and the bottom five performing schools was even starker when looking at the percentage of students passing _**both**_ math and reading (see column \"% Passing Both\"). Among the top five performing schools, over 90% of the students were passing both math and reading whereas only less than 55% were passing in both math and reading among the five worst performing schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Overall, there does not seem to be major differences across high school grades for each school.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Limitations:\n",
    "    -  this was a very small sample of schools and it seems hard to generalize findings from 15 schools only\n",
    "    -  the data did not include some important background data about the students. Typically large district schools include a much more diverse student body than charter schools, in particular a higher percentage of students with special needs. Also, some studies have shown that if we control for socio-economic status, then the differences between charter and district schools fade away.\n"
